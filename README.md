==========

Scheduler application designed for lab environments

This is non-flight code intended for use in a prototype or lab environment. It uses a text-based (XML) 
scheduler table and message table.  The scheduler table defines which messages (defined in the message)
table should be sent in each scheduler table slot. This application follows the object-based application
design pattern.

This is a beta release and it has some known issues but it does basic scheduling.
